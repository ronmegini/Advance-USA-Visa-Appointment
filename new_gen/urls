Notes:
- Not working when logged out
- 96 json name for Tel Aviv, 97 for Jerusalem 
- Same ID for user (not changing)
- The request as I understand it: https://ais.usvisa-info.com/he-il/niv/schedule/<user_id>/appointment/days/<96=tlv,97=jrs>.json?appointments[expedite]=false
- The endpoint protected with nginx 429 too many request
- session cookie called _yatri_session

Questions:
- Not sure once in how long it refresh dates (feels pretty static)
- Not sure for how long the login session is alive
